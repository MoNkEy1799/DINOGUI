# DINOGUI ðŸ¦•
Trying to make a GUI library in C++ using Win32 API and Direct2D/ DirectWrite.
All GUI elements are implemented by myself and are not simply calls to the default Windows ClassNames (i.e. CreateWindow(L"BUTTON", ...)).

The GUI is event driven to minimize draw calls and save resources.

## Quickstart

To get started, first create a `DINOGUI::Core` widget which is the base window for all other widgets. The create other widgets (preferably on the heap) and `place` them. Lastly start the event loop by calling the `run` methode.

```cpp
#include <Dinogui.h>

int main()
{
    DINOGUI::Core* core = new DINOGUI::Core("Example Window", 400, 400);
    DINOGUI::Button* button = new DINOGUI::Button(core, "My Button");
    
    button->place(200, 200);
    
    core->run();
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Widgets

Currently implemented:
 - Button
 - Label
 - Checkbox
 - Textedit (unfinished)
 - Images (unfinished)
